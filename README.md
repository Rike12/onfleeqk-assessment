## Responsiveness

The project is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes and devices.

## Challenges

- **Design Images**: The design provided in the Figma file was an image, making it difficult to export all images. As a result, I had to improvise with the available assets.
- **Candlestick Chart**: I couldn't replicate the exact candlestick chart from the design, so I used the closest available alternative.
